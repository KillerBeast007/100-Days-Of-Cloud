# AWS Day 03: Create Subnet

## Objective
Create a logical partition within a VPC to launch resources.

## Services Used
- **AWS**: VPC (Subnets)

## Key Learnings
- Learned how CIDR blocks work. Encountered a "CIDR overlap" error and solved it by selecting a unique IP range (e.g., 172.31.128.0/24) that wasn't already in use.
