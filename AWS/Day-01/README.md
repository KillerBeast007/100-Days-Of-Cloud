# AWS Day 01: Create Key Pair

## Objective
Establish a secure method for remote authentication to Linux instances.

## Services Used
- **AWS**: EC2 (Key Pairs)

## Key Learnings
- Learned that AWS doesn't store the private key (.pem file); if you lose it, you lose access to the instance. Also learned about the importance of setting correct file permissions (chmod 400).
