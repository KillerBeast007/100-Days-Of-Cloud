# AWS Day 04: Allocate Elastic IP

## Objective
Obtain a persistent public IP address.

## Services Used
- **AWS**: EC2 (Elastic IP)

## Key Learnings
- Learned that standard public IPs change when an instance is stopped, but an Elastic IP stays the same. Also noted that AWS charges for Elastic IPs that are allocated but not attached to a running instance.
