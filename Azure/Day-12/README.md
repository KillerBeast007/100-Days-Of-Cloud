# Azure Day 12: Add and Manage Tags for Azure Virtual Machines

## Objective
Use metadata (tags) to categorize Azure resources for better billing and management.

## Services Used
- **Azure**: Azure Resource Manager (Tags).

## Key Learnings
- Learned that tags consist of a Name/Value pair (e.g., Environment: Production or Department: DevOps).
- Realised that tags are essential for "Cost Management" to see exactly how much money a specific project is spending.
- Unlike AWS where tags are often added during creation, Azure makes it very easy to manage and "bulk edit" tags for multiple resources at once via the Portal.
